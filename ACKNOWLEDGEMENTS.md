Canopy builds on ideas from the Moss project of Greenhouse Software. Greenhouse is [hiring](http://greenhouse.io/careers).

Moss itself was improved by the suggestions of Tharsan Bhuvanendran, Aaron Gibralter, Bradley Griffith, Mark McDonald, Mike O'Neil, Dana Pieluszczak, and Rob Rosenbaum, the infrastructure support of Elena Washington, and the participation of the Greenhouse team.

Canopy was improved by Phil Melnick and Isaac Gamus.
