Canopy builds on ideas from the Moss project of Greenhouse Software. Greenhouse is [hiring](http://greenhouse.io/careers).

Moss itself was with the help of Tharsan Bhuvanendran Michael Boufford, Adam Creegar, Aaron Gibralter, Bradley Griffith, Kate Hooker, Tim Johnson, Mark McDonald, Juan MÃ¼ller, Mike O'Neil, Dana Pieluszczak, Rob Rosenbaum, Jon Stross, Elena Washington, Andrew Zirm, and the participation of the Greenhouse team, and builds on ideas discussed with Robert Dondero, Erika Milam, Taylor Francis, David Hammer, and Raymond Zhong.

Canopy was improved by Phil Melnick and Isaac Gamus.
