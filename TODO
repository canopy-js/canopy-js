- Try to make source subdirectories that don't need to import from other subdirectories.
– Consolidate termology in code -- eg topic/context/namespace, key/topic
– Create linter that checks eg if there is a parenthetical reference that isn't followed by another local reference to the same, & checks for orphan subtopics generally.
– Pressing up on root should return to referrer
– Consider adding key without paragraph concept
– Refactor import reference code by constructing mixed namespace
– Come up with better name for alias links
– Audit all defaulting in code eg null subtopic name – maybe its desirable to guarentee subtopic always exists
– Audit every code path happens
– Make sure all calls to render go through setFragmentId - list code paths
