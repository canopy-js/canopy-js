Error: local/global reference ambiguity

Two references exist in topic [England] to target [London] and it is unclear
  which is the local reference, and which is a global reference.

================================ First Reference ===============================

It is ambiguous whether reference [[London]] in subtopic [England] of topic
  [England] is a local reference, a global reference, or an import reference
  anchored to topic [Arkansas].

If you intended this link to be a global reference, you can fix this error one
  of two ways:

1. You can change the name of the other subtopic to not match the name of the
  global reference so that it is clear that is the local reference.
2. You can use explicit global syntax to clarify this is a global reference, ie,
  [[London#London]].

If you intended this link to be an import reference, you can fix this error one
  of two ways:

1. You can change the name of one of the subtopics to not match the other so
  that it is clear that the other is the local reference.
2. You can use explicit import syntax to clarify this is an import reference,
  ie, by writing [[Arkansas#London]] in a paragraph that has an anchoring global
  reference like [[Arkansas]].

=============================== Second Reference ==============================

It is ambiguous whether reference [[London]] in subtopic [Essex] of topic
  [England] is a local reference, or a global reference.
