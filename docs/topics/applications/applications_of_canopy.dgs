Applications of Canopy: The Canopy library has various applications. There are applications of Canopy in programming. There are applications of Canopy in academia and journalism. There are applications of Canopy in library science.

Applications of Canopy in programming: The original author of a codebase is often more comfortable maintaining it than are later team members. Canopy can help original authors organize the information they know, such as which parts of the code power which features, where certain decisions are made, and what the original motivations for various design choices were. One could begin at a buisiness requirement, and look at the features that satisfy it, the design decisions made for that feature, and the code that implements it, or one could begin with a line of code and work up, seeing what it does, and why, all the way to the original buisiness requirement.

Applications of Canopy in academia and journalism: Some of the same subjects that are dicussed in popularly are also studied in academic institutions. If explanations that were produced in academia were organized differently, it might be more easy for journalists and popular commentators to connect stories of the day to long-term historical or economic analyisis, allowing readers who begin at a story to drill into its larger themes, and for students of theoretical ideas to find practical examples of how they play out in the world.

Applications of Canopy in library science: For any set of books, one can imagine a librarian who has read all of them, and could answer questions like "what author addresses this or that point", and without taking sides, that librarian could through quotations put one author in conversation with another, and could list for you all the arguments made in the literature for one position or the other, and the responses, in neutral terms, exerting judgement only in the potential meaning of terms in ordinary language. Therefore, for any set of static resources and a shared language, there exists a set of valid "library diagraphs", which present the indexing of the different parts of those resources by what questions they address and what answers they give, and it might be desirable to produce such diagraphs for popular consumption.
